A simple pet-project made on vanilla JS for study purposes.
Based on the following libs: leaflet, charts...

it allows either to pick a place on the map or write in the specific place in the input form and get (if there is any data) current information about air quality there based on 2 parameters (pm2.5 & pm10)
you can swipe slides and examin the information in the form of a table or charts.
